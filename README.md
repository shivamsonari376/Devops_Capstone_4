# Devops_Capstone_4

Project Title: End-to-End DevOps Pipeline for a Web Application with CI/CD


Problem Statement
DevOps teams require a CI/CD pipeline to streamline the development and deployment process, ensuring that changes are consistently tested, built, and deployed across environments. Using Jenkins as the CI/CD orchestrator, this project will implement an automated pipeline for a Dockerized application that deploys to Kubernetes on AWS EKS. Jenkins will also automate infrastructure provisioning, configuration management, and deployment, reducing manual intervention and improving efficiency.

Project Goals
1. Design an application architecture that includes load balancing, container orchestration, and monitoring on AWS.
2. Provision AWS infrastructure using Terraform, including VPC, subnets, and EKS clusters.
3. Automate configuration management with Ansible to streamline server setup and application configuration.
4. Deploy the application on Kubernetes within AWS EKS, ensuring scalability and resilience.
5. Implement Jenkins CI/CD for continuous integration and deployment from code changes to production.
6. Set up monitoring with Prometheus and Grafana to monitor infrastructure and application performance.
   


 Additional Tools for CI/CD Integration
- Jenkins: For orchestrating the CI/CD pipeline to automate testing, building, and deployment.
- Docker: For building container images as part of the CI pipeline.
- Kubernetes CLI (kubectl): For managing and deploying resources to EKS within the Jenkins pipeline.
- Jenkins Plugins: Docker, Kubernetes, and AWS CLI plugins for seamless integration with cloud infrastructure.



Project Sprints:


 Sprint 1: Architecture Design, Dockerization, and Jenkins Setup
- Tasks:
  - Design the application architecture for deployment on AWS EKS.
  - Dockerize the web application by creating a Dockerfile and storing the image in AWS ECR.
  - Set up a Jenkins server on AWS EC2 and configure necessary plugins (Docker, Kubernetes, AWS CLI).
  - Configure Jenkins to access EKS and AWS resources using credentials and AWS IAM roles.
  - Set up Git integration for Jenkins to trigger builds based on code changes.
- Goal: Complete the application architecture, Dockerize the application, and establish a Jenkins server for CI/CD.



 Sprint 2: AWS Infrastructure Provisioning with Terraform and Jenkins Integration
- Tasks:
  - Write Terraform scripts for AWS resources: VPC, EKS cluster, subnets, security groups, and EC2 instances.
  - Create a Jenkins job to automate the Terraform infrastructure provisioning process.
  - Test the Terraform job on Jenkins, ensuring that infrastructure is provisioned consistently across environments.
  - Store Terraform state files securely in AWS S3 for consistent multi-user access.
- Goal: Automate AWS infrastructure provisioning through Jenkins and Terraform, enabling reproducible environments.



 Sprint 3: Configuration Management with Ansible and Jenkins Pipeline
- Tasks:
  - Write Ansible playbooks to configure EC2 instances, install Docker, kubectl, and other dependencies.
  - Create a Jenkins pipeline job to run Ansible playbooks for setting up and configuring resources on AWS.
  - Ensure the Ansible job on Jenkins is triggered after the Terraform job completes, creating a seamless flow.
  - Test the Ansible playbooks on infrastructure provisioned by Terraform to validate configurations.
- Goal: Automate configuration management with Ansible through Jenkins, ensuring consistent and reliable server configurations.



 Sprint 4: CI/CD Pipeline for Application Deployment on Kubernetes (EKS)
- Tasks:
  - Create a multi-stage Jenkins pipeline for the application, including stages for build, test, and deployment.
  - Build the Docker image in the pipeline and push it to AWS ECR.
  - Use Jenkins to run Kubernetes manifests (Deployment, Service) that deploy the application to EKS.
  - Configure Kubernetes health checks and auto-scaling in the deployment pipeline.
  - Test the end-to-end pipeline from code push to deployment on EKS, ensuring proper functionality.
- Goal: Build a fully automated CI/CD pipeline that deploys the application to Kubernetes on AWS EKS.



 Sprint 5: Monitoring Setup with Prometheus, Grafana, and Jenkins Alerts
- Tasks:
  - Install Prometheus in the EKS cluster for monitoring metrics and configure it to collect data from the application and nodes.
  - Set up Grafana to visualize Prometheus metrics and create dashboards for application performance and resource health.
  - Integrate Jenkins with Prometheus/Grafana to monitor job and infrastructure health.
  - Set up alerting rules in Prometheus for critical metrics and configure Jenkins to send notifications for failed deployments or resource issues.
  - Test monitoring and alerting, ensuring visibility into the health of the infrastructure and application.
- Goal: Provide real-time monitoring and alerting using Prometheus, Grafana, and Jenkins notifications for efficient infrastructure management.



 Sprint 6: Testing, Documentation, and Final Pipeline Automation
- Tasks:
  - Write test cases to validate application functionality, deployment success, and infrastructure integrity.
  - Document each step in the Jenkins pipeline, Terraform, and Ansible setup, including configuration and troubleshooting.
  - Automate the Jenkins job triggers for each stage of the pipeline (e.g., code change triggers build, build triggers deploy).
  - Conduct final end-to-end testing to verify the stability of the CI/CD pipeline, monitoring, and infrastructure setup.
  - Collect feedback and make adjustments as needed for a production-ready setup.
- Goal: Finalize and document the CI/CD pipeline, testing its readiness for production deployment.



 CI/CD Pipeline Stages in Jenkins

1. Build Stage: 
   - Triggers when code is pushed to the repository.
   - Builds Docker images for the application and pushes them to AWS ECR.
   
2. Infrastructure Provisioning Stage:
   - Runs Terraform scripts to provision infrastructure (VPC, EKS, EC2) on AWS.
   - Stores Terraform state in AWS S3 for persistence and team collaboration.

3. Configuration Management Stage:
   - Runs Ansible playbooks to configure EC2 instances and Kubernetes nodes.
   - Installs necessary dependencies and ensures security and access configurations.

4. Deployment Stage:
   - Deploys the application to the EKS cluster using Kubernetes manifests.
   - Configures load balancing, auto-scaling, and health checks for resilient deployment.

5. Testing and Monitoring Stage:
   - Runs test scripts to validate application functionality post-deployment.
   - Sets up monitoring with Prometheus and Grafana, with alerts configured for real-time notifications.
